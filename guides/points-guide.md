BloxStreet provides players with an alternative to ranking up, which is through our points system. Players may earn points by completing certain tasks or purchasing them with Robux. Players who are planning to/have already purchased points are strongly encouraged to read through this guide carefully.

## Points Policy
{: .text-red-300 }

* Lying about rank purchases or faking evidence of purchased points will result in a permanent ban.
* Abusing rank privileges will result in consequences.
* Claiming a rank through the points system will decrease a playerâ€™s chances of future promotions. The higher the rank purchased, the lower the chances of a promotion will be. SHRs encourage players to work their way up through hard work and dedication instead.
* Players must abide by all rules and regulations, regardless of whether they purchased a rank or not. Those who fail to abide by all guidelines will be subject to the same moderation actions as everyone else, including demotions, blacklists, and permanent bans.

## Points Clarifications/Regulations
{: .text-red-300 }

* Reclaiming ranks is prohibited and will result in a permanent ban, regardless of whether it is claimed with old or new points. However, players are permitted to reuse points to claim a rank they have not claimed previously.
* HRs who have been reformed or have resigned may NOT reclaim any HR rank, regardless of whether it is with new or old points. Doing so will result in a permanent ban, regardless of whether the HR was aware or not. However, reformed and resigned HRs are permitted to reuse old points to claim a rank they have not claimed previously.
* LRs and MRs who have been previously demoted ARE permitted to reuse points to claim a rank they have not claimed previously.
* There is NOT a cooldown for players who choose to rank up by exclusively claiming ranks through the points system, however cooldowns do apply to players who have previously claimed a rank and are wanting to receive a promotion.
* Formerly blacklisted/permanently banned players are NOT permitted to use the point system if their appeal has been accepted. Doing so will result in consequences, regardless of whether the player was aware or not.
* Players who are blacklisted may NOT use the point system until their appeal is accepted. Doing so will result in a permanent ban.
* If Executive Assistant and/or Store Executive go on sale, players may NOT claim those respective ranks. Doing so will result in consequences.
* Players may NOT partake in any act of point cheating/grinding. Doing so will result in a demotion to Customer. Examples of point cheating/grinding include but are not limited to:

  * Assisting an alternate account in an attempt to farm points.
  * Joining a small server in an attempt to grind tasks.
  * Taking items off of a shelf and restocking them shortly after.
  * Completing tasks when simply unnecessary (ie: running around the store and waiting until a shelf is empty).

If a player is found violating any of the regulations above, inform an SHR through a ticket immediately. Note that attempting to find loopholes around any of the regulations above is prohibited and will result in severe consequences.
