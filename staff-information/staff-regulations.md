All staff members are required to wear an official BloxStreet uniform while on duty. Staff members may equip a uniform by interacting with a locker and selecting their desired uniform.
  
  Things to keep in mind:
  *  Refusal to wear a uniform will result in consequences.
  *  BloxStreet merchandise from the group’s store IS acceptable as long as the uniform is up to date. 
  *  Uniforms with a Target logo are considered outdated.

## In-Game Conduct
{: .text-red-300 } 

  *  Professionalism is required while in public eye. Behaving unprofessionally reflects badly on our group.
  *  LR+ are to be working while on duty at the store, Board of Directors+ are exempt. Staff members who mess around at the store will receive consequences. If a staff member wishes to converse with others and/or take a break from their general duties, they should go off duty.
  *  Staff members who choose to act unprofessionally while off duty will be subject to the same consequences one would receive while on duty.
  *  Staff members may NOT go idle in the middle of the store. If a staff member wishes to go idle, they may respawn into the staff room by resetting their character.
  *  LRs and MRs may NOT interact with trollers; instead, consult with an HR+ official, as they are trained to handle certain situations.
  *  Staff members are expected to comply with orders issued by an HR+ official. Failure to comply with certain orders will result in consequences.
  *  Abusing admin, the warning system, cuffs, or any permissions will result in consequences.

## General Conduct

  *  Respect all decisions made by SHRs. If a player has a question or concern regarding a decision made by a Senior High Rank, they may consult with one through a ticket.
  *  Do not instigate drama, regardless of whether the other player is at fault. If a player has an issue with a fellow staff member, it should be reported to a Junior Moderator+ privately. Keep all personal drama OUT of the staff team.
  *  Administrative action is FINAL. Any questions or concerns regarding administrative action inflicted upon a player should be directed through a TICKET. Complaining about administrative action will only lead to further consequences.
  *  Staff members are expected to remain professional at both affiliated and non-affiliated establishments. Failure to do so will result in consequences.
  *  Professionalism must be maintained to a certain degree within the communications server. Staff members are more than welcome to converse with one another, but all topics must be appropriate and within reason.
